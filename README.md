## Development

1. Clone the repo or download the ZIP

2. Install packages

First run `npm install yarn -g` to install yarn globally (if you haven't already).

Then run:

4. Install [Metamask extension](https://metamask.io/) in your browser

5. Add Polygon Test network in your metamask
- Go to https://chainlist.org/?search=mumbai&testnets=true
- Write `mumbai` in `serch networks` and select `Include Testnets`
- Click on the `Conect Wallet`
